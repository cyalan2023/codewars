// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
    room1: {
        name: "Имя",
        description: "description",
        completed: "completed"},
    room2: {
        name2: "Имя2",
        description2: "description2",
        completed2: "completed2"},
    room3: {
        name3: "Имя3",
        description3: "description3",
        completed3: "completed3"}
}
